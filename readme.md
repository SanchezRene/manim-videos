## DataVisualsLab Reels Code
This repository contains the Python code used to create vertical-format data visualization 
videos with __ManimCE__, which are shared as Instagram reels.

## About
The scripts in this repository are used to generate visually engaging animations 
that simplify complex data concepts. These animations are created using ManimCE 
and are then posted as reels on my Instagram account [@datavisualslab.](https://www.instagram.com/datavisualslab/)


## Usage
To run the animations locally:

Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git`

Install the required dependencies:
`pip install manimce`

Run the animations:
`manim -pql path/to/script.py`
